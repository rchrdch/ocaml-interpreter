# ocaml-interpreter
I coded an interpreter in OCaml for a small stack-based bytecode language. It has its own grammar definitions, parsers, and is able to run numerous commands, such as push, pop, basic arithmetic calculations, Boolean operations, support for scoping, variable binding, function declarations/calls, if/else statements, etc.
